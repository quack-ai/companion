<Accordion title="Can I self-host Quack companion?">
  Of course, head over to [self-hosting guide](/guides/self-hosting) to get started.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is this open-source?">
  Yes, all the resources and code for you to run the service are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/quack-ai/companion) and under license [Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Are you doing anything with my data?">
  Whether you use the cloud or community version, the IDE integration lets you control the data you share (even completely cut it off). By default, we collect your GitHub user ID and events (you editing guidelines) to improve the product.
  Additional details available [here](https://github.com/quack-ai/companion?tab=readme-ov-file#telemetry).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Any difference between the cloud & community versions?">
  The cloud version doesn't require you to orchestrate any additional service, install the [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quackai.quack-companion) you're good to go.
  By default, it always ships with our best performing models. The community edition sees support for experimental features a bit later (making sure you can run the service locally without damaging your hardware or slowing it down).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Which IDEs are supported?">
  For now, we support [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and we'll gradually add support to other development environments.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Which programming languages are supported?">
  The models we use are trained on the most popular languages, we'll make available additional language-specific performances soon. The languages with the best experience so far are Python and Javascript/Typescript.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Which LLMs are you using?">
  The cloud version gets updated more frequently than the community version, with LLMs ranging from 7b params to 40b depending on the task.
  For the community version, the choice is up to you! But here are the best options: using locally-run open-source models.
  We plan to add support to additional LLM APIs, but for open-source models, here are the ones we recommend: [Deepseek Coder 6.7B](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-6.7b-instruct), [Gemma 7b](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-7b-it), or [Dolphin Mistral 7b](https://huggingface.co/cognitivecomputations/dolphin-2.6-mistral-7b-dpo-laser) (finetuned from [Mistral 7B v0.2 instruct](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2)).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is the difference with GitHub Copilot?">
  You could see Quack as GitHub Copilot with a consistent & dynamic context of the software development culture of your team. We'll help you establish clear & comprehensive expectations and embed them in every keystroke seamlessly.
  You will find little difference in benefits if you are coding on your own though.
