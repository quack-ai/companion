## Add Quack Companion to VSCode

### Initial setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="GitHub account">
    For now, the extension authentication works using [GitHub](https://github.com/).
    You'll need an account to use our services, check this [tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github) if you don't have one already.
  </Step>
  <Step title="IDE setup">
    Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) on your computer (support of other IDEs will follow).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install the extension">
    Go to [VS Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quackai.quack-companion), to [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/quackai/quack-companion) or look for "Quack Companion" in the [VSCode extension tab](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace).
    Once installed, follow the quick walkthrough to authenticate.

### Using Quack Companion in your IDE

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create guidelines (optional)" icon="pen-to-square">
    Click on the "+" sign in the Coding guidelines webview to create one. Make it specific enough so that it looks like a linter rule.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Chat with Quack" icon="comments">
    All your curated guidelines are embedded in the chat view. Quite a similar experience to [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) or [Copilot Chat](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/github-copilot-chat/using-github-copilot-chat-in-your-ide)
  </Step>
